Search API
==================

Search API's RestAssuredService will provide foundation for developers who wants to write client application for some REST based resource by allowing developer to store the resources as in a schema-less storage system and access this resource as programmable objects as opposed to a REST resource.

Features:
- Transform a single resource into certain object type and access the resource in form of object.

Requirements:
- Algorithm to define how to transform REST resource into the correct Java based object.
- Resolver to define where the Search API will find the REST resources.
- Domain object representation of the REST resource.
- Configuration document to tie all the above together.

Check the sample in the code to see how to do this. Happy coding!
